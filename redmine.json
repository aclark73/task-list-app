Whenever I go to search for an event I usually change the dates at the sidebar to my time window, then spend a couple seconds wondering why there are no earthquakes showing up, then realize I have to go to the drop down menu to select \"Custom Query\" instead of \"Past 30 Days\".  It doesn't take long for me to remember, but I'd imagine new users probably run into this too. Perhaps if the date is changed to something beyond 30 days (or changed at all, since anything they change it to would be different than past 30 days), the drop down menu could change automatically to \"Custom Query\". That may be hard to implement, but I thought I'd get it out there in case it is not.\r\n\r\nThank you for the useful tools!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nKasey","start_date":"2015-07-17","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":1,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Difficulty","value":"Medium"}],"created_on":"2015-07-17T22:18:03Z","updated_on":"2016-01-11T21:10:50Z"},{"id":2788,"project":{"id":18,"name":"Wilber"},"tracker":{"id":5,"name":"Task"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":3,"name":"Low"},"author":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"assigned_to":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"subject":"User survey","description":"In preparation for the next round of development, gather feedback from users based on what we learned in the HCI class.","start_date":"2015-07-16","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":1,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Difficulty","value":"Medium"}],"created_on":"2015-07-16T22:00:58Z","updated_on":"2016-01-11T21:10:50Z"},{"id":2716,"project":{"id":2,"name":"DMC Website"},"tracker":{"id":5,"name":"Task"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":3,"name":"Low"},"author":{"id":10,"name":"Rob Newman"},"assigned_to":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"fixed_version":{"id":100,"name":"Scorcher"},"subject":"Data Services website to work under HTTPS","description":"Requires making all paths protocol agnostic","start_date":"2015-07-02","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":1,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Difficulty","value":"Medium"}],"created_on":"2015-07-02T21:39:22Z","updated_on":"2016-01-11T21:10:50Z"},{"id":1531,"project":{"id":65,"name":"FDSN Website"},"tracker":{"id":2,"name":"Feature"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":3,"name":"Low"},"author":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"assigned_to":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"fixed_version":{"id":100,"name":"Scorcher"},"subject":"Auto-assign network request review to Gale once it is completed","description":"If Tim goes through the whole review process, it will be marked as completed -- at this point it should be auto-assigned to Gale for addition to Netpeople.","start_date":"2014-12-05","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":1,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Difficulty","value":"Medium"}],"created_on":"2014-12-05T19:52:08Z","updated_on":"2016-01-11T21:10:49Z"},{"id":876,"project":{"id":65,"name":"FDSN Website"},"tracker":{"id":2,"name":"Feature"},"status":{"id":7,"name":"On hold"},"priority":{"id":3,"name":"Low"},"author":{"id":10,"name":"Rob Newman"},"assigned_to":{"id":3,"name":"Adam Clark"},"fixed_version":{"id":88,"name":"Dickie V"},"parent":{"id":1206},"subject":"FDSN upload and parse of Excel station list and interface for download (StationXML)","description":"h2.
